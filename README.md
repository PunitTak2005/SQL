## **Introduction**

This repository showcases a variety of SQL-based projects that I've worked on during my academic journey and personal development. It features multiple database designs and SQL queries that aim to solve problems in different domains like ride-sharing, courier systems, and job recruitment systems. I'm constantly improving and adding new projects to this repository to expand my skills and knowledge.

## **Project**

1. **Courier Delivery System**  
   - **Description**: Manages package deliveries, courier details, and customer information.
   - **Key Features**: Tables for Couriers, Deliveries, Packages, and Customers with appropriate queries to manage deliveries.

## **Database Structures**

 Project has a clearly defined schema that includes tables and relationships among them. Some of the key components of these databases include:

- **Normalization**: All database schemas are normalized to avoid redundancy.
- **Foreign Keys**: Used to maintain referential integrity between tables.
- **Indexes**: Added in relevant tables to improve query performance.

## **SQL Queries**

Included in this repository are various SQL queries for tasks such as:

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for managing data.
- **Joins**: Various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to combine data from different tables.
- **Subqueries**: Nested queries for complex data retrieval.
- **Aggregations**: SQL queries with GROUP BY and aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.).
- **Transactions**: Queries involving transactions for ensuring data consistency.

## **How to Use**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PunitTak2005/SQL.git
